# GCloud Security Engineer Notes

These notes are by no means comprehensive. I created them as a quick reference for refreshing my memory, so some topics that are easy to remember might be missing. If you want to prepare for the exam, check out YouTube videos and read the documentation. I recommend getting a Cloud Skill Boosts subscription to learn from the Security Engineer Learning Path.
